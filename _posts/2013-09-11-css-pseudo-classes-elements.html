CSS can be very selective!
======
I'm not going to explain how to use these, or what they are. This is simply a handy dandy list of CSS pseudo classes and elements that you can use.  
<br /><br /> 
	:hover<br />
	:focus<br />
	:target<br />
	:active<br />
	:visited<br /><br />

	:enabled<br />
	:disabled<br />
	:checked<br />
	:indeterminate<br /><br />

	:root<br />
	:first-child<br />
	:last-child<br />
	:only-child<br />
	:nth-child(n)<br />
		:nth-child(even)<br />
		:nth-child(odd)<br />
		:nth-child(2n) /* Even */<br />
		:nth-child(2n+1) /* Odd */<br />
		:nth-child(3n) /* Every 3rd element */<br />
		:nth-child(4n+1) /* Every 4th element starting with the 1st */<br />
	:nth-of-type(n) /* Like :nth-child, but used where elements at the same level are of different types */<br />
	:first-of-type<br />
	:last-of-type<br />
	:nth-last-of-type(n) /* like nth-of-type, but counts up from the bottom */<br />
	:nth-last-child(n) /* like nth-child, but counts up from the bottom */<br />
	:only-of-type /* selects only if the element is the only one of its kind within the parent */<br /><br />

	:not(s) /* selects all except the parameter */<br />
	:empty /* selects elements which contain no text and no child elements */<br /><br />

	:first-letter<br />
	:first-line<br />
	:lang<br /><br />

	::selection<br />
	::-moz-selection<br /><br />

	:before<br />
	:after<br />
