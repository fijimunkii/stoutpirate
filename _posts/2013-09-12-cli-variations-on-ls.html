We use `ls` to list the directory. Here are some operators you use to extend the functionality of ls.

```
ls -1 sort by name
ls -1r sort by name in reverse order
ls -1r --group-directories-first display folders before filez
ls -t sort by modified date
ls -tr oldest first
ls -S sort by filesize
ls -Sr smallest first
ls -X sort by extension
ls -l long listing (file attributes)
ls -l | sort -k 3 pipes the listing through sort (by column 3 - owner name)
ls -l | sort -k 3, 3 -k 9 sort by owner and filename
ls -lisa | awk '{print $5, $7, $11}' | sort pipes the detailed listing through awk, which prunes the output, and then piped through sort
