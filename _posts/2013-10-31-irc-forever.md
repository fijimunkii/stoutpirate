#What is IRC? A chat protocol.

####Why would you want to use it?

+ it is free!
+ supports file transfer
+ has clients for every platform
+ is super efficient
+ many networks, public and private

It is amazing for learning and asking questions. Say, for instance, you are learning the Ruby programming language. The *official* ruby language IRC channel exists on irc.freenode.net

I've spent years fiddling around with IRC, have settled on a wonderful commandline client, and am happy to share my configuration with the world.

**On a mac with homebrew installed, this guide should be easy to follow.** If you're using linux, the instructions should make sense and you can still use my config.


#Let's get started
If you don't have homebrew installed, [follow the official instructions](http://brew.sh/)

Open up your terminal and type in ```brew install irssi```
Congratulations! You now have the best irc client!!

You can totally use it, as is, but I recommend tweaking the settings a bit.

Load irssi for the first time by typing in ```irssi```. This will create the default configuration files that we will be editing. ```/quit``` to exit.

####Themes make things pretty!

1. [find a theme you like](http://irssi.org/themes)
2. copy the .theme link
3. in terminal run ```wget -P ~/.irssi copied_link``` to install theme
4. load up irssi and run ```/set theme theme_name```
5. ```/save```

####Scripts make life easier!
*Lets set up a highlight window*, this will log every time someone mentions your name:

1. in terminal run ```wget -P ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/ http://static.quadpoint.org/irssi/hilightwin.pl```
2. load up irssi
3. we're going to set up a split window to view the hilights
4. ```/window new split```
5. ```/window name hilight``` this name is important so the script knows where to send the info
6. ```/window size 4```
7. ```/hilight -word yournick```
8. ```/help hilight``` for advanced features.
9. ```/layout save``` to save this configuration

*Advanced Windowlist!* install the same way as hilight:

1. ```wget -P ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/ http://anti.teamidiot.de/static/nei/*/Code/Irssi/adv_windowlist.pl```
2. load up irssi
3. to see all available settings for type ```/set awl```

*Usercount* displays the number of users in the channel

1. I think you know the drill by now
2. http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/usercount.pl

#Configuration is unlimited
*I'll make it easy for the world by sharing my config file.*

Exit out of irssi by typing it ```/quit```

Lets open the config file ```open ~/.irssi/config```

Copy what you like. Be careful with formatting...

1. find YOURNAME and replace with your own nickname
2. find THEMENAME and replace with your installed theme

#### How to Navigate

* ```/s server.address``` to connect to a server
* ```/j #channel``` to join a channel
* ```/msg nick``` to send a private message
* ```escape [channel number]``` to switch channels
* in the status window ```ctrl x``` changes the server you are interacting with
* ```/quit``` exits irssi
