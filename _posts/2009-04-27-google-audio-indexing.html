<strong><i>Update 8-29-2013 </i>-- Google GAudi appears to have been retired and the google group along with it has been expunged!</strong><br /><br />
Google is using speech recognition to index political videos on youtube.  With a search, one can easily find what a politician has to say about a particular subject. <a title="http://labs.google.com/gaudi/" href="http://labs.google.com/gaudi/">http://labs.google.com/gaudi/</a><br /><br />

Google wants to unleash this powerful tool to index all of youtube's shenanigans, after they've tested it on politics.  I think it will make a major impact on how we access information.<br /><br />

What google says about the technology:
<blockquote>Google Audio Indexing uses speech technology to transform spoken words into text and leverages the Google indexing technology to return the best results to the user.<br /><br />

The returned videos are ranked based -- among other things -- on the spoken content, the metadata, the freshness.
<br /><br />
We periodically crawl the YouTube political channels for new content. As soon as a new video is uploaded to YouTube, it is processed by our system and made available in our index for people to search.</blockquote>
I did some research into what they are actually using to detect the speech patterns.  It is called <a href="http://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/comp.speech/Section6/Recognition/htk.html">Hidden Markov Modelling</a>.  Here is a pdf explaining some of the <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/CRL-97-7.pdf">mathematics behind it</a>.
<br /><br />
I would like to share some other documents I came across that I thought were interesting:
