Most articles I come across are lost in a sea of advertisements and bad formatting.  While advertising surely has its place, I feel that it is unfair to distract the user when they have committed 5 minutes out of their day to read what you have to say.  Perhaps I am a glutton for simplicity, but I prefer being able to finish an article in one go, rather than having my eyes darting all over a page.<br /><br />

Luckily for people easily distracted like myself, some javascript genius has figured out how to automatically pull the article content out of a page and display it in a customizable, easy to read overlay, toggled by a bookmarklet.<br /><br />

A bookmarklet is a bookmark that instead of loading a new page, runs a small application on the current page.  <a href="http://readable-app.appspot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Readable</strong></a>, the bookmarklet in the spotlight, is easy to install.  Either drag it to your bookmarks bar, or right-click and save as a bookmark.  The author's website <a href="http://readable-app.appspot.com/" target="_blank">further explains</a>.<br /><br />

The way it transforms a page is entirely based on your preferences.
<br /><br />
I prefer reading light text on a dark background, so I chose the 'dark grey' color.  The layout size, or width, that I prefer is 50mm.  The rest I left the defaults.<br /><br />

Now when I'm reading any article, the first thing I'll do is hit my Readable bookmarklet.  What this accomplishes for me is increased readability, efficiency, and usability of the internet.<br /><br /><br />
