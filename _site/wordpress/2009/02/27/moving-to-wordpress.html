There are many benefits to having a blog on WordPress.  Most people enjoy the beautiful interface and plethora of plugins.  I like that the software is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software" target="_blank">open-source</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">free to download</a>.  This means that you can have a WordPress blog on your personal domain for free.

Have a Blogger account but want the functionality of WordPress? It's easy to make the switch, let me show you.

First, you need to understand that there are two ways to use WordPress: .ORG and .COM  <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress.ORG</a> provides the free download of the WordPress software, while <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.COM</a> provides free hosting for your blog with a variety of paid upgrades.  If you have your own server, you'll want to download the software and <a href="http://base.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=59462" target="_blank">ftp</a> it.

If you just want a blog and don't know what I'm talking about then head on over to <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank">wordpress.COM</a>!

Click the big 'sign up now' button to get started.  Enter in all of your information and you'll be registered and delivered to your admin page.

From here you can quickly import your information from Blogger.  Just click the Import under Tools on the left-hand side column.

You'll see that WordPress can also import from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="_blank">Movable Type</a>, and <a href="http://www.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Typepad</a>.  Just click on the blog you want to import and follow the prompts to give it access to your information.  They make it really easy.
